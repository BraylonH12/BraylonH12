### _PlayStation Career Pathways GameJam_ ###

My involvement with **<ins>PlayStation Career Pathways at Sony Interactive Entertainment</ins>** has provided me with valuable, hands on experience in the Software Engineering Industry.
Check out my contributions as a <ins> **Gameplay Programmer** </ins> with **Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints** in the first ever PlayStation Career Pathways GameJam [here](https://braylonheavens.myportfolio.com/playstation-career-pathways-gamejam). I also served as a <ins> **Audio Programmer** </ins> and <ins> **Sound Designer** </ins> in this GameJam as well, implementing code to determine when and how sounds are played. You can also check out my <ins>Original Soundtrack</ins>, released on all streaming platforms, for our game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEgBP5mUp6w&t=653s), as well as our official demo walkthrough [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U5BS2WCfg4).

As a result of this GameJam, our team was able to secure **<ins>1st Place</ins>** :EMOJICODE🏆 !! We were also able to win awards presented to the team with the best **<ins> Time Management</ins>**.
I also won an award for the **<ins>Most Improved GitHub</ins>**

### _KWALeague_ ###

My repository titled <ins> _KWALeague_ </ins> is a personal project inspired by my love for basketball and sports video games. I created original algorithms and data structures to accomplish a text-based game loop played inside a terminal. You are given full flexibility to root for a pre-existing team, change any pre-existing team, or even create your own. Given other input, such as how many rounds each team will play, the program simulates games with random number generators. At the end of the season is seeded and placed into a 16 team tournament algorithm I created myself. After the champion is decided, the next season begins.

If you'd like, you are able to playtest this game by downloading the files in the repository and executing them in a text editor such as VScode.
