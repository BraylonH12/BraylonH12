###_ _PlayStation Career Pathways GameJam_ _###

My involvement with PlayStation Career Pathways at Sony Interactive Entertainment has provided me with valuable, hands on experience in the Software Engineering Industry.
Check out my contributions as a Gameplay Programmer with Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints in the first ever PlayStation Career Pathways GameJam [here](https://braylonheavens.myportfolio.com/playstation-career-pathways-gamejam). I also served as a Audio Programmer and Sound Designer in this GameJam as well, implementing code to determine when and how sounds are played. You can also check out my original soundtrack, released on all streaming platforms, for our game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEgBP5mUp6w&t=653s), as well as our official demo walkthrough [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U5BS2WCfg4).
